# Hazard identification

A QMRA has always for origin an initial statement on the specific objectives of a risk assessment (the risk question). The risk question should precisely define (see @fig-hazard_id):

-   the microbiological hazard(s) causing the adverse effect
-   the foods of interest
-   the population of interest

One can cite an example of risk question: "What are the isk of *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella* infection linked to chiken meals prepared in households in Dakar, Senegal ([@pouillot2012]).
