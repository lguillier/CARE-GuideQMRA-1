# Hazard identification

A QMRA has always for origin an initial statement on the specific objectives of a risk assessment (the risk question). The risk question should precisely define (see @fig-hazard_id):

-   the microbiological hazard causing the adverse effect
-   the foods of interest
-   the population of interest

The following chapters aims at identifying the data of interest for characterizing the pathogens contamination of foods and the population.
