One may adopt qualitative and/or quantitative method. It may consider determnisitic or stochastic\nThe QMRA approach can help to answer various questions. For examples, (Mota et al. 2022) identified the following objectives:\n\nevaluation of illness risk,\nassessment of interventions,\nsimple exposure assessment,\nor risk ranking.\n\nEach objective is associated to specific starting point (farm, food industry, retail,…), output (score or risk, mean annual risk, DALY,…) and data needs.\nOne of the main challenge is to identify the appropriate approach to tackle the risk question. In this context, EJP OH COHESIVE proposes a decision support tool to help risk assessor: COHESIVE Decision Support Tool. The tool helps to define the best approach according to the objective and time available.\nOnce the approach has been chosen, the main challenge is to gather data. Different types of data can be collected (microbial concentrations, daily consumption, etc.). The collected data should be fit for purpose, representative and allow a meaningful analysis (Haberbeck et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective of this document\n\n\n\nOur goal is to provide an help to identify data/knowledge that risk assessors and data scientists need at the start of their projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersioning of the document\n\n\n\nThis is the first release (September 2022) of the “Guide for accessing relevant data and models for quantitative microbial risk assessment”.

    "text": "3.1 FoodEx2\n\n3.1.1 Scope\nIn 2015, EFSA developed a food classification and description system called FoodEx2 ((EFSA) 2015), which is used for its data exchange with Member States. This system describes a large number of individual foods, grouped into food groups and broader food categories, classified using a formal hierarchical parent-child relationship (ontology). Most of the food names are generic, allowing the user to classify several similar foods under one name attached to a unique code. Facets” can be used to add details about the characteristics of the food. The current version of FoodEX2 has eight hierarchies: six pre-selected domain-specific food hierarchies based on an intended target use (exposure, zoonosis, veterinary residue, etc.). There is also a complete hierarchy (“Master hierarchy”), for terminology management, and a general hierarchy oriented towards data capture (“Reporting hierarchy”). The latter has been used to select the food categories of interest, providing a common repository of food descriptions. It comprises 10,366 terms divided into three broad categories, “Food”, “Feed” and “Non-food matrices”, up to 10 levels deep (hierarchy levels H1 to H10).\nFoodEx2 also offers facets, which are used to add more detail to the information provided by the selected term in the food list. These facets are collections of additional terms describing the properties and aspects of the food from different angles. Thus, it is possible to provide information on the source of the food, the preservation process, the intended use, etc.\n\n\n3.1.2 Accessibility\nLatest Foodex2 version is available in Efsa knowledge junction in Zenodo (Authority 2022). The list of terms can be accessed by exploring the FOODEX.xlsx file or by using the catalogue browser. It’s is a Java-based application that allows to use and browse catalogues released by EFSA in the Data Collection Framework. The Food Standards Agency also provide an web-page allowing to navigate at the different levels of the FoodEx2 hierarchies: FSA_foodtype.\nAnother way to access FoodEx2 is to use the EFSA FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application. It can be accessed in the R4EU platform (users should register). The tool aims to simplify the coding process by making use of AI techniques. Starting from the food description given as input, the tool provides suggestion of complex FoodEx2 terms (combination of base term and facets). Figure 3.1 shows an example of use of EFSA-SCA.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example of use of the Smart Coding Application"

It is an evolving knowledge repository intended to be the go to reference source for the microbial risk assessment community.\n\n\n8.1.2 Accessibility\nA dedicated section of QMRA wiki is dedicated to dose response models (QMRA wiki - DR). Completed dose response Models are available for several pathogens including bacteria, prion, protozoa and virus. For each pathogen, the data used, the model used and the parameters fitted on the different data are provided.\nA synthetic table of recommended best-fit parameters is also available for each pathogen. These recommanded fitted models are recommanded to be used in most circumstances. However, it’s up to the user to consider all available models to decide which one is most appropriate.\n\n\n\nExample of recommended Best-Fit Parameters for different pathogens in QMRA wiki\n\n\nThe users has also the possibility to assess through a web interface QMRA wiki - Tool :\n\nThe probability of illness given a dose\nThe dose associated to a given probability\nThe possibility to fit a model for user defined data"

    "text": "In order to go beyond the number of disease-related cases, two concepts are generally used: the QALY  (for Quality-Adjusted Life Years) and the DALY (for (Disability-Adjusted Life Year). QALYs correspond to the life years gained with an intervention, taking into account the quality of life during these years. A QALY is assigned a coefficient of 1 if it is a healthy year and less than 1 if the quality of life is reduced. These coefficients are based on population surveys.\nThe DALY metric quantifies the gap between a life lived in perfect health and the current health status, as the number of healthy life years lost due to illness (as Years Lived with Disability, YLDs) and to premature death (Years of Life Lost, YLLs)."
