# Burden of disease data

In order to go beyond the number of disease-related cases, two concepts are generally used [@pires2021]: the QALYÂ  (for Quality-Adjusted Life Years) and the DALY (for (Disability-Adjusted Life Year). QALYs correspond to the life years gained with an intervention, taking into account the quality of life during these years. A QALY is assigned a coefficient of 1 if it is a healthy year and less than 1 if the quality of life is reduced. These coefficients are based on population surveys.

The DALY metric quantifies the gap between a life lived in perfect health and the current health status, as the number of healthy life years lost due to illness (as Years Lived with Disability, YLDs) and to premature death (Years of Life Lost, YLLs).

## Burden of communicable diseases (BECoDE toolkit)

### Scope

ECDC initiated the BCoDE project in 2009 to estimate the burden of communicable diseases using the DALY metric to summarize the overall burden in a single measure and compare the relative burden of each communicable disease. The BCoDE toolkit is a stand-alone software that estimates DALYs for 117 communicable diseases and six healthcare-associated infections.

### Accessibility

The BCoDE toolkit is downloadable as a zip archive (<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/BCoDE_v2.0.0.zip>). The toolkit includes an embedded tutorial, disease models describing the progression pathway of each disease, input tables and several output vizualisation options. The only necessary input is the number of yearly cases, but the other parameters can also be edited if needed (@fig-becode).

## The **European Burden of Disease database.**

### Scope

The European Burden of Disease network is an international technical platform allowing researchers to increase their skills in interpreting and conducting BoD studies, and to support methodological advances in the field of BoD.

The European Burden of Disease network is separate in five working groups with specifics focus:

-   non-communicable diseases and injuries

-   infectious Diseases

-   Risk Factors

-   Methods

-   Knowledge Translation

The European Burden of Disease database contains the records related to burden of diseases in Europe.

### Accessibility

The European Burden of Disease database is available on this link : <https://www.burden-eu.net/outputs/bod-database>. The user can filter his research by topic, country or key words.

## WHO DATA for global burden of foodborne

This report provide the first estimates of global foodborne disease incidence, mortality, and disease burden in term of Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALYs). 31 foodborne haz ards causing 32 diseases are include (11 diarrheal disease agents, 7 infectious disease agents, 10 helminths and 3 chemicals). Summary measures of public health were used as a measure of the burden of foodborne disease. The DALY metric was chosen because it is an established WHO metric with international application and it is consistent with the Global Burden of Disease project. This report contains a large amount of aggregated data about the measure of the burden of foodborne disease that can be used in the risk assessment (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/199350/9789241565165_eng.pdf).
