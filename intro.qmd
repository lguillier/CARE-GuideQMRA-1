# Introduction

By the late 1990s, concepts of risk and risk assessment have been employed to inform decision-making for the management of food safety risks. Modern food safety policies are intended to be risk-based [@koutsoumanis2016].The framework for carrying out risk assessments of foodborne pathogens is well established [@microbio2021] and relies on four components including hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization @fig-qmra.

If the QMRA approach is well structured, the method used by the risk assessor can vary. One may adopt qualitative and/or quantitative method. It may consider determnisitic or stochastic

The QMRA approach can help to answer various questions. For examples, [@jdom_2022] identified the following objectives:

-   evaluation of illness risk,

-   assessment of interventions,

-   simple exposure assessment,

-   or risk ranking.

Each objective is associated to specific starting point (farm, food industry, retail,...), output (score or risk, mean annual risk, DALY,...) and data needs.

One of the main challenge is to identify the appropriate approach to tackle the risk question. In this context, EJP OH COHESIVE proposes a decision support tool to help risk assessor: [COHESIVE Decision Support Tool](https://rawcdn.githack.com/RDewar/Decision-support-tool-EJP/c369a4f897ed09ef9c8b6e6fbc58d42014a298bf/Workingtool1.html). The tool helps to define the best approach according to the objective and time available.

Once the approach has been chosen, the main challenge is to gather data. Different types of data can be collected (microbial concentrations, daily consumption, etc.). The collected data should be fit for purpose, representative and allow a meaningful analysis [@Haberbeck2018].
